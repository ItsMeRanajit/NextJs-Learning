by default all folder in app folder server comp. 

to specifically make any comp client side comp we have to mention "use client" directive at the top of the file to make it client side.

whenever we are using any hooks like useState or other client side management things its important to mention them as 'use client'

state management in react is primarily handled in the client side


Q. now the question is  when to use server comp and when to use client ?

-> use server comp default. only use client comp when its needed

-> server comp - fetching data, accessing backend resourses, 
                wehn you want keeping sensitive info,  when you want to reduce the js load on client side

-> client comp - evt listeners, hooks, custom hooks that depends 
                on browser only apis, class components
