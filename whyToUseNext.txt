1. uses server side rendering -
    react uses client side rendering, means when user uses a react app the serversends the js html and other files then its rendered in users comp. but it is a slow process. bcz the rendertime depends on the users device.
        next js uses server sider rendering, means the server sends the rendered html and css files and the rendering is done on the server. which reduces the load time
    this helps for SEO

2. creating routes - 
    for routing in react we use react router that we have to do manually but in next the routing done automatically. and it uses file base routing , means we have 3 files home, about and contact, next creates routes for each file automatically

3. fullstack app -
    next has a feature named api routes. which helps to use serverless routes, it helps to build and use apis without worrying about the server stucture. with this feature we can create a api endpoint .to do this we need to make a file route.js which works as api endpiont for that file.

4. automatically code splitting -
    next spilts a large code into chucks and gets render when it is used. we can also do it in react but its manual there but in next it is automatic

5. its still just react but with added more feature
